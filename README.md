# Tests scripts

Quick and dirty scripts to load a lot of vectors into Xata.

Relevant scripts are:

* sentences_to_xata.py - computes embeddings using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and loads them into Xata.

* random_to_xata.py - computes random embeddings and loads them into Xata.

* vector_search.py - performs a vector search for a given phrase, computing the embedding using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.

* random_search.py - performs a vector search for a random vector.
